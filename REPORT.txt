Overall submission:
We finished part 1 fully as required, we generated those pictures as requested which is under result folder.The folder contains a number of subfolder which named by its feature. And each subfolder contains view from two different perspectives.
For part 2, we choose to implement following features:
Anti-aliasing
Soft shadows
Texture-mapping
Environment mapping
Glossy reflection
Refraction
Compound object containing quadratic surfaces

Those features are all successfully implemented,the individual results are contained under result folder.

*******Note*************
We used Macbook to implement Assignment3 and some paramaters is different from those in Linux, the final image in Linux looks slightly different than what we got on mac.


File structure:
Our results is store under result directory which includes different
pcitures result for different features.




What we have implemented:

Casting ray 
Ray-sphere intersection
Ray-square intersection
Phong illumination 
Recursive ray tracing
Hard shadows
Anti-aliasing
Soft shadows
Texture-mapping
Glossy reflection
Environment mapping
Refraction
Compound object containing quadratic surfaces
